## 1. `INTRODUCTION` <a name="introduction"></a>
First of all, greetings to those people who are interested in the project from **Ethernal OT**. First of all I have to mention that since the OTServer is not hosted on a Virtual Private Server (VPS), I am forced to host it locally from my Unit.

However, that It is not a limitation to be able to enjoy this OTServer. As I mentioned before, since it is not on VPS or VM I had to resort to the famous LocalHost from **Radmin VPN**, known by several people for being used as a Dedicated Server for players without money to host a Server/OT/Game ( That is me.)

Without further ado, let's get started with the installations.

## 2. `RADMIN VPN INSTALLATION` <a name="installation"></a>
### What is Radmin VPN?
Radmin VPN is a free software that allows you to create a secure virtual private network (VPN) between computers over the Internet. It is primarily designed to connect devices remotely, simulating a local area network (LAN), making it easier to access resources. shared, online games and collaborative work.

## 3. `CONFIGURATION OF RADMIN VPN` <a name="configuration"></a>

To be able to enter EthernalOT you must enter the Private Network credentials. You may wonder how do we do it?

Once Radmin is installed in step nÂ°2 we will configure it as follows manner.
